Mobile-Local
By Aseem Kohli

Notes:

- The application loads the current location upon launch.  To get the current location again, the app has to be reloaded.
- The weather and news are displayed on the first screen
- To input a new location, click the "Menu" button in the top left.
- The "Menu" button will also take you to your previous search history.
- The application was only tested with United States locations
- Occasionally Google Maps will translate a misspelled location to a location outside of the U.S.
- Yahoo! Maps could not determine weather for certain locations, such as "Long Beach, CA".  I have an error thrown in this case.
- Sometimes the background images do not load in Chrome (this was intermittent).
